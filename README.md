### Tree register or tree locations of Vienna
In addition to trees in streets, the tree register also includes trees in parks and forest-like areas in Vienna. The trees in streets are completely covered, as they serve the MA 42 as a work tool. The trees in parks and forest-like areas, however, are only partially recorded.

### Visualizations
